# change (positioning / challenge)

## Knowledge of change in infrastructure is key to maintain uptime
## How do you track change?
## DSC by itself offers little historical information on what changes were done in your environment
## why no simple button

# dsc loss of time (effect)

## Lost time investigating manually why something did or did not change
## No one portal or api to use
## Have to search through many different logs using different tools

# automate it! (need)

# Script to pull data from DSC Pull Server

# It's a script, not a solution
# Parse the data yourself
# Can't share report to other departments

# puppet *and* dsc (solution)

## (solution) PE presents the logs and diagnostic information from each node in a central, queryable, databse for reporting
## You already have Puppet and PowerShell DSC working together on your systems at your company
## Puppet made it easy to plug in DSC to handle special circumstances while Puppet handled the rest of the configuration management on your servers, no matter the platform.

# good times (benefits)

Reports for most cases
Queryable provides customized reporting
single way to view logs and diagnostic information across all of your nodes without manual effort
information collated for you without have to do extra configuration

# only me (differention)

## DSC logs in a central place
## No scripts or queries to find logs after fact

# summary

# PE presents the logs and diagnostic information from each node in a central, queryable, databse for reporting
